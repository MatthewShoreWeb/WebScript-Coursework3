Summary of what I have learnt:
-----------------------------

### Node JS:


### POST and GET requests:

This coursework I learned a lot about implementing POST and GET requests in Node Javascript. Prior to this coursework I had some limited experience at doing POST and GET request such as in previous courseworks and some work in my own time. However, this coursework developed my skills in sending and manipulating data that has been posted to the server. For example, I had not implemented a JSON database previously meaning I had never really send data to a JSON file from the server and recieved data on the clients end from a JSON file.

AJAX is also a technology which I had previously not really used that much. Previously, I had use location.reload() to reload an entire web page, however, using AJAX has improved the quality of my system by enabling background refresh. A couple of improvements that I could have made to my system however, would have been to only execute the AJAX requests when a POST button is pressed (to eliminate the need for a refresh rate) and to have used AJAX for post requests to prevent the page redirecting. However, due to limited time I was unable to implement these two features.


### HTML development:



### Javascript development:




### CSS development:

This coursework allowed me to improve the quality of my CSS from previous projects and work that I have done. The improvements that I have done to my CSS include:
1. Using media querys to have different style options for devices below a certain screen size. This allows for improved scalability on smaller devices such as mobile phones.
2. Seperating styling by common attribute. In this coursework I ,for the first time, grouped HTML elements with the same properties together using commas. Then I could add any unique style options later. While this is not particularly advanced, it was nevertheless something which was unknown to me and has contributed to the development of my CSS skills in this project, greatly improving the CSS quality.
