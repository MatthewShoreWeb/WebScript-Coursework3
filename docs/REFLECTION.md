Summary of what I have learnt:
-----------------------------

### POST and GET requests:

This coursework I learned a lot about implementing POST and GET requests in Node Javascript. Prior to this coursework I had some limited experience at doing POST and GET request such as in previous courseworks and some work in my own time. However, this coursework developed my skills in sending and manipulating data that has been posted to the server. For example, I had not implemented a JSON database previously meaning I had never really send data to a JSON file from the server and recieved data on the clients end from a JSON file.

AJAX is also a technology which I had previously not really used that much. Previously, I had use location.reload() to reload an entire web page, however, using AJAX has improved the quality of my system by enabling background refresh. A couple of improvements that I could have made to my system however, would have been to only execute the AJAX requests when a POST button is pressed (to eliminate the need for a refresh rate) and to have used AJAX for post requests to prevent the page redirecting. However, due to limited time I was unable to implement these two features.
