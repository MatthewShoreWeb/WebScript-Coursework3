Summary of what I have learnt:
-----------------------------

POST and GET requests:

This coursework I learned a lot about implementing POST and GET requests in Node javascript. Prior to this coursework I had some limited experience at doing POST and GET request such as in previous courseworks and some work in my own time. However, this coursework developed my skills in sending and manipulating data that has been posted to the server. For example, I had not implemented a JSON database previously meaning I had never really send data to a JSON file from the server and recieved data on the clients end from a JSON file.

AJAX is also a technology which I had previously not really used that much.
