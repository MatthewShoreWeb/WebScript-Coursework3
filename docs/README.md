Program Explanation:
-------------------
The purpose of my application is to display information about a programming project to a team of programmers. The idea is that, for example there would be a team of programmers all working in the same room in an office and there would be a monitor on the wall running the unattended display so that at a glance they can view useful information such as the people involved in the project, the client and the project deadline.

Additionally, the program also can display an array of messages that the user would like to be displayed on the project board. The message board will load a new message every 5 seconds without having to refresh the page using AJAX get requests to access the JSON file in which they are stored.

How to use the program:
