Program Explanation:
-------------------
The purpose of my application is to display information about a programming project to a team of programmers. The idea is that, for example there would be a team of programmers all working in the same room in an office and there would be a monitor on the wall running the unattended display so that at a glance they can view useful information such as the people involved in the project, the client and the project deadline.
